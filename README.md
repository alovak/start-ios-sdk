# Start iOS SDK
*Start is a payment gateway for Startups*

This iOS SDK makes it easy for developers to accept payments inside mobile application.
## Intro
Due to security rules from Visa/MasterCard developers canâ€™t transmit card details directly to their server and have to use PCI DSS certified environment for this. Instead, card details are sent directly to our server and we return a card token in the response. The card token uniquely identifies each card, and can be used in all API calls that require a card e.g. create charge or customer.

Sometimes, during the payment process an additional 3D Secure verification may be required. This adds more complexity to payment flow. With mobile SDK we hide this complexity from developer.
## Getting Started
Before you start you have to sign up for a Start account [here](https://dashboard.start.payfort.com/#/public/sign_up?secretLink=true) and get API keys for SDK following the [instruction](https://docs.start.payfort.com/guides/api_keys/#how-to-get-api-keys).
## Installation
#### Using CocoaPods
Install SDK usign [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) by adding the following pod to your [Podfile](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html):

	pod 'StartSDK', :git => 'https://github.com/payfort/start-ios-sdk.git'
#### Using Carthage
You can also intall SDK using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application) by adding the following statement to your [Cartfile](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#cartfile):

	github "payfort/start-ios-sdk"
## Usage
#### Objective-C
```objc
@import StartSDK;

...

NSInteger centsToPay = 100; // 1 USD

StartCard *card = [StartCard cardWithCardholder:@"John Smith"
                                         number:@"4242424242424242"
                                            cvc:@"123"
                                expirationMonth:10
                                 expirationYear:2020
                                          error:nil];

Start *start = [Start startWithAPIKey:@"your API key goes here"];

[start createTokenForCard:card amount:centsToPay currency:@"USD" successBlock:^(id <StartToken> token) {
	// Use token.tokenId when performing payments through API
} errorBlock:^(NSError *error) {
	// Process error
} cancelBlock:^{
	// User cancelled payment verification
}];
```
See [Demo view controller](Demo/Demo/ViewController.m) for more detailed example.
#### Swift
```swift
import StartSDK

...

let centsToPay = 100 // 1 USD

let card = try! StartCard(cardholder: "John Smith",
                              number: "4242424242424242",
                                 cvc: "123",
                     expirationMonth: 10,
                      expirationYear: 2020)

let start = Start(apiKey: "your API key goes here")

start.createToken(for: card, amount: centsToPay, currency: "USD", successBlock: { token in
	// Use token.tokenId when performing payments through API
}, errorBlock: { error in
	// Process error
}, cancel: {
	// User cancelled payment verification
})
```
See [Demo view controller](DemoSwift/DemoSwift/ViewController.swift) for more detailed example.
#### Note
`Start` shows alert telling user about additional verification if required. To provide custom texts for the alert, [localize](https://www.oneskyapp.com/academy/learn-ios-localization/) the [following keys](StartSDK/StartSDK/Models/Start.h):
- `payfort_start_verification_message`
- `payfort_start_verification_button`
